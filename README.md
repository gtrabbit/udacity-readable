# "Readable" 

This single-page application was build for Udacity's React Nanodegree. The focus of this project was to integrate Redux for state management of a React application with asynchronous data flow via Thunk. The application's front-end mimicks a message-board format, allowing users to make posts within specified categories, comment on those posts, and vote on both comments and posts. CSS is pre-processed with SASS, and Internet Explorer polyfills provided with core-js.

## Getting started

To launch the application, you will need the back-end api server located [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). Download or clone this repository, navigate into the directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the server. To get the server running, navigate into the `api-server` directory and launch the server with `node server`.

Next, download or clone this repository into a separate directory, open a second terminal window and similarly run `npm install`. In the same directory, run `npm start` to launch the application. This should open your browser to localhost:3000. If this does not happen, simply enter the address into your browser manually.

Enjoy
